            As my hometown, Jakarta holds a special place in my heart. 
            It's where I was born and would like to live in the future. 
            It's also a place where my parents live. 
            Jakarta has been one of the most important cities in Indonesia. 
            From the time it was part of Sunda Kingdom and named Sunda Kelapa, 
            to the Dutch era and called Batavia, to the present days as Indonesia's capital up until new-proposed Indonesia's capital Nusantara take over that status. 
            I always liked Jakarta apart from its not-so-good things, such as the Tanjung Priok port in North Jakarta, the high-end residential areas and shopping malls in South Jakarta, 
            and the epicenter of the Indonesian government like its ministries and other institutions in Central Jakarta. 
            Oh, and don't forget some old buildings mostly from the Dutch occupation era that still standing, even though sadly most of them have already been demolished no matter if there's a rule against it. 
            Yes, like most developed countries, we still have problems with justice. Personally, South Jakarta is my favorite area along with East one (because I grew up there). 
            I like the fact it's the place where high-profile people live (artists, celebrities, high-rank government officials), I like that to me it has a good city design (the roads, the buildings), 
            I like the fact it was designed to be a garden city so no wonder I feel like it has lots of trees and gives that calming nuance, 
            I like the fact there are multiple locations there that are used by classic/performance car/motorbike owners to gather every Sunday morning. 
            In conclusion, my hometown, Jakarta sits in a special room in my heart.
