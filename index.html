        Hi, there! Today we're going to talk about Mr. Olympia 1980's winner controversy. Was Arnold really the winner? 
        I'm sorry, welcome to my personal site. This website was originally made for the Web Programming class assignment. 
        Through the navbar on top, you can look up my profile, a brief explanation about my hometown, some local food in my hometown,
        and also some tourist spots. Enjoy!
