            The National Monument (Indonesian: Monumen Nasional, abbreviated Monas) is a 132 m (433 ft) obelisk in the centre of Merdeka Square, Central Jakarta, symbolizing the fight for Indonesia. 
            It is the national monument of the Republic of Indonesia, built to commemorate the struggle for Indonesian independence.
            Its construction began in 1961 under the direction of President Sukarno. Monas was opened to the public in 1975. It is topped by a flame covered with gold foil.<br>
            <h4>2. Grand Indonesia</h4>

            Grand Indonesia (previously called Grand Indonesia Shopping Town until 2016) is an integrated multipurpose complex at Thamrin Road in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. 
            The 640,000 m<sup>2</sup> (6,900,000 sq ft) complex consists of a huge Shopping Mall, office tower Menara BCA (BCA Tower), 
            high end serviced residential tower Kempinski Residences and the five-star all-suite Hotel Indonesia Kempinski. It is located near the Selamat Datang Monument. 
            In January 2017, Forbes recognized Grand Indonesia as one of the top five shopping malls in Jakarta.<br>
            <h4>3. Kota Tua Jakarta</h4>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Fatahillah.jpg" alt="Image of Kota Tua Jakarta" id="imagelocalfood"> <br>
            Kota Tua Jakarta (Indonesian for "Jakarta Old Town"), officially known as Kota Tua, is a neighborhood comprising the original downtown area of Jakarta, Indonesia. 
            It is also known as Oud Batavia (Dutch for "Old Batavia"), Benedenstad ("Lower City", contrasting it with Weltevreden, de Bovenstad ("Upper City")), or Kota Lama (Indonesian for "Old Town").
            The site contains Dutch-style structures mostly dated from 17th century, when the port city served as the Asian headquarters of VOC during the heyday of spice trade.
            It spans 1.3 square kilometres within North Jakarta and West Jakarta (Kelurahan Pinangsia, Taman Sari and Kelurahan Roa Malaka, Tambora). The largely Chinese downtown area of Glodok is a part of Kota Tua.<br>
            <h4>4. Gelora Bung Karno (GBK)</h4>
            <img src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0b/95/c5/69/20160608-154922-largejpg.jpg?w=1200&h=-1&s=1" alt="Image of GBK" id="imagelocalfood"> <br>
            Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium (Indonesian: Stadion Utama Gelora Bung Karno; literally "Bung Karno Sports Arena Main Stadium"), formerly Senayan Main Stadium and Gelora Senayan Main Stadium, 
            is a multi-purpose stadium located at the center of the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex in Central Jakarta, Indonesia. It is mostly used for football matches. The stadium is named after Sukarno, 
            the then-president of Indonesia, who sparked the idea of building the sports complex. When first opened prior to the 1962 Asian Games, the stadium had a seating capacity of 110,000. 
            It has been reduced twice during renovations: first to 88,306 in 2006 for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup and then to 77,193 single seats as part of renovations for the 2018 Asian Games and Asian Para Games,
            where it hosted the ceremonies and athletics competitions. The capacity of 88,083 makes it 7<sup>th</sup> largest association football stadium in the world. 
            Due to the most recent renovation which saw all remaining bleachers replaced by single seats, it is the 28<sup>th</sup> largest association football stadium in the world and the 8<sup>th</sup> largest association football stadium in Asia.
            The complex is usually open for the public to use it for jogging around the stadium, especially on Sunday morning.<br>
