            <h4>1. Ketoprak</h4>
            <img src="https://b.zmtcdn.com/data/pictures/1/18581751/69509404157b9dbf1a0e87bdd965401b.jpg" alt="Image of Ketoprak" id="imagelocalfood"> <br>
            Ketoprak is a dish that usually consists of fried soy tofu, rice noodles, cucumber, bean sprouts, rice cake "Lontong", served with peanut sauce, soy sauce, fried onions, and fried crisp "kerupuk".
            according to popular Betawi tradition, ketoprak was actually derived from the acronym of its ingredients; which are ket from ketupat, to from tahu and toge, and prak from digeprak (Betawi for: "mashed" or "crushed"), 
            which describes the method of grounding garlic, chili pepper, and peanut granules together to create the peanut sauce.<br>
            <h4>2. Nasi Uduk Betawi</h4>
            <img src="https://beritakendari.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nasi-uduk.jpg" alt="Image of Nasi Uduk Betawi" id="imagelocalfood"> <br>
            Nasi uduk is steamed rice cooked in coconut milk. Betawi in its name means it's unique to Jakarta (Batavia was Jakarta's name back in the Dutch occupation era).
            Nasi uduk Betawi usually consists of uduk (cooked in coconut milk) rice, orek/kering(dry) tempeh, semur jengkol, fried noodle/rice noodle, balado potatoes, boiled egg, and so on.
            There are a lot of side dish variations since there's no strict rule on what should be on a nasi uduk Betawi. <br>
            <h4>3. Kerak Telor</h4>
            <img src="https://ecs7.tokopedia.net/blog-tokopedia-com/uploads/2019/07/Kerak-Telor.jpg" alt="Image of Kerak Telor" id="imagelocalfood"> <br>
            Kerak telor is a traditional omelette dish. It is made from glutinous rice cooked with egg (usually duck or chicken) and served with serundeng (fried shredded coconut), 
            fried shallots, and dried shrimp as topping. It is considered as a snack and not as a main dish. 
            The vendors of kerak telor are easily the most ubiquitous during annual Jakarta Fair and it has also become a must-have menu item for visitors at the event.
            Its vendors also can be found on historical sites in Jakarta that are used as a tourist spot.<br>
